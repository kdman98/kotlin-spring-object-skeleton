As we use Kotlin, we can call methods from Singleton classes without creating and maintaing Classes, not using any config files or Bean control of Spring Framework.

So, if a developer wants to use Spring Framework and its features with simpler way to maintain Services and Repositories, this might be a good skeleton code for it.
